Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DrivePass system was designed to help clients pass there driving tests with effective and efficient methods.
What did you do particularly well?
I felt like I created the diagrams well. 
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I believe that I would be a bit more descriptive in my explanations - and also read instructions more carefully. 
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
First, I read the transcript and made a list of what the users wants and needs were. Then I created UML designs to break down the structure of the project in order to code more effectively. 
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I would definitely use UML diagrams in the future more often. I didn’t realize how helpful they were in this class. I really helped me understand the start and beginning of the project.
